 * the damage is concrete: `resolveAction` has no default branch, so an unknown
 * mode makes it return undefined and the shortcut hook throws while
 * destructuring it, on the first key pressed.
 *
 * **Both ways in have to be checked.** A value read at startup arrives through
 * `getItem`, but a value another tab writes arrives through `subscribe`, which
 * parses the new string itself and never consults `getItem`. Checking only the
 * former leaves the session open to exactly the value it refused to start with.
 *

 * which is both marked unstable and has that same gap: it replaces `getItem`
