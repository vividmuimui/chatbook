 *

 * keyboard, a tap on the page's edge and a citation followed out of an answer,
 * so watching the state they all land in is the only place that sees every
 * turn. Hanging the write off each of them instead would quietly miss the next
 * one added.
 *
 * Nothing is written until `locationReady` — the place may still be arriving
 * from the server, and page 1 written over it would be the reader's place lost
 * rather than kept. The first thing seen once it is ready is the place that was
 * just restored, which is taken as already saved rather than handed back.
 *
 * That is true wherever the place came from: a book opened at a place the URL
 * named — a reload, a shared link, a quoted passage — is not handed back either.
 * What reaches the server is the first place the reader moves to afterwards,
 * which carries the whole place with it.
 *
 * A narrow screen leaves both panels out of what it sends: there the outline is
 * a drawer that shuts itself on every jump and the chat a sheet, and saving
 * those would fold away what a wide screen deliberately opened. The server
 * keeps whatever it had.
