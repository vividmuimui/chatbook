/**
 * Keep the page being read and the chat open on it in sync with the URL, and

 *
 * This hook owns every parameter of the reader's URL, and is the only thing that
 * writes them. `setSearchParams` does not merge within a commit, so a second
 * writer working from its own copy of the query would drop whatever the first
 * one had just put there — and one handler moves the page and the chat at once.
 *
 * The reader's own state is the single source of truth: the URL is read once per
 * book and written on every change. Watching the URL as well would make the
 * two effects feed each other, and the reader would bounce between pages.
 *
 * A `#:~:text=` fragment — what Chrome's "Copy link to highlight" writes — wins
 * over `?page=`, since it names the passage the reader actually wants.
 *
 * `passageMiss` is how a link that named a passage but did not deliver it says
 * so, and which of the reasons it was: the book opens on page 1 either way, and
 * a quote that is nowhere in the book means something different to the reader
 * than a book of one page or a lookup that never answered.
 *
 * The chat named by the URL can only be reopened once `book` arrives, since the
 * highlight it is about is read out of it. `openChat` is the reader's own opener,
 * so a restored chat is the same thing as one picked off the list.
 *
 * The two panels are not in the URL at all: whether the outline and the chat sat
 * beside the page is the book's own answer, taken from `readingState` however
 * the book was opened. A URL that names no place at all — a book opened from the
 * shelf — takes the page and the chat from there too, which is how a book put
 * down on one device is picked up on another.
 *
 * `locationReady` says the reader's place has settled, one way or the other. It
 * is what keeps the saver from writing page 1 and the width's own idea of the
 * panels over the place still being restored.
