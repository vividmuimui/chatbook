/**
 * The API under `/api`, with the two replies no route writes itself.
 *
 * Hono's own defaults answer an unhandled throw and an unknown path in
 * `text/plain`, which is the one shape the client cannot read: `fetcher`
 * reports anything that is not the `{ error: { code, message } }` envelope as
 * `UNKNOWN`, so a D1 outage reached the reader as "something went wrong" with
 * nothing behind it. These two put every reply back inside the envelope.
 *
 * Only `/api/*` reaches the Worker (`run_worker_first` in wrangler.jsonc), so
 * `notFound` here cannot answer for a deep link into the SPA.
