 * The migrations that ran before the book's own conversation existed, and the

 *
 * Split rather than applied together because the rebuild has a part that only
 * runs when there is something to carry: every other test file builds its
 * database from the whole list at once, which leaves `chat_messages` empty at
 * the moment the table is dropped and made again. That part of 0005 is the only
 * thing in this repository that can lose a reader's answers, so it is run here
 * the way a deploy runs it — on a database that already holds conversations.
